    <string name="summary_race_dragonborn">Born to fight, &lt;b>dragonborn&lt;/b> are a race of wandering mercenaries, soldiers, and adventurers. Long ago, their empire contended for worldwide dominion, but now only a few rootless clans of these honorable warriors remain to pass on their legends of ancient glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Dragonborn&lt;/b> favor the Warlord, Fighter, and Paladin classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_dwarf">Carved from the bedrock of the universe, &lt;b>dwarves&lt;/b> endured an age of servitude to giants before winning their freedom. Their mighty mountain fortress-cities testify to the power of their ancient empires. Even those who live in human cities are counted among the staunchest defenders against the darkness that threatens to engulf the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Dwarves&lt;/b> favor the Paladin, Cleric, and Fighter classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_eladrin">Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, &lt;b>eladrin&lt;/b> live in cities in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities lie close enough to the world that they sometimes cross over, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Eladrin&lt;/b> favor the Wizard, Rogue, and Warlord classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_elf">Wild and free, &lt;b>elves&lt;/b> guard their forested lands using stealth and deadly arrows from the trees. They build their homes in close harmony with the forest, so perfectly joined that travelers often fail to notice that they have entered an elven community until it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Elves&lt;/b> favor the Ranger, Rogue, and Cleric classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_halfelf">Descended from elves and humans, &lt;b>half-elves&lt;/b> are a vital race in which the best features of elves and humans often appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Half-elves&lt;/b> favor the Warlord, Paladin, and Warlock classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_halfling">&lt;b>Halflings&lt;/b> are a small race known for their resourcefulness, quick wits, and steady nerves. They are a nomadic folk who roam waterways and marshlands. No people travel farther or see more of what happens in the world than halflings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Halflings&lt;/b> favor the Rogue, Ranger, and Warlock classes.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_human">Of all the civilized races, &lt;b>humans&lt;/b> are the most adaptable and diverse. Human settlements can be found almost anywhere, and human morals, customs, and interests vary greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Humans&lt;/b> are able to excel at any class you choose.</string>
    <string name="summary_race_tiefling">Heirs to an ancient, infernal bloodline, &lt;b>tieflings&lt;/b> have no realms of their own but instead live within human kingdoms and cities. They are descended from human nobles who bargained with dark powers, and long ago their empire subjugated half the world. But the empire was cast down into ruin, and tieflings were left to make their own way in a world that often fears and resents them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b>Tieflings&lt;/b> favor the Warlock, Warlord, and Rogue classes.</string>
